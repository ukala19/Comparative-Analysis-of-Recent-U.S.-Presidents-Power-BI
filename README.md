# Comparative-Analysis-of-Recent-U.S.-Presidents-Power-BI

Part-2
I have gathered information on the 10 most recent US Presidents and used Microsoft Power BI to
create a dashboard that highlights their similarities and differences. The dashboard is based on
the gathered data, providing visual representations of key insights regarding the Presidents'
characteristics. I have gathered data on the presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy
Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, William J. Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama,
Donald J. Trump, and Joseph R. Biden. Here is the snapshot of the data I gathered:

Using the data collected, I have created an interactive dashboard using Power BI which is considered a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool.
Towards the top right corner, you can see using the “Select President” drop-down on selecting which you can see the stats of that president on the dashboard. Next to that, you can see the C-SPAN score of each president which is a Presidential Historians Survey ranking score, indicating the president's historical standing as assessed by a group of historians and experts.

**Findings:**
Based on the data collected, Ronald Reagan has the highest C-SPAN score, and Barack Obama stands second.
Considering the 10 most recent presidents, we can infer that the number of Presidents elected from the Republican party is greater than the Democrat party.
William J. Clinton holds the record for the highest number of total executive orders among all presidents.
Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and William J. Clinton served the longest as Presidents, while Joseph R. Biden has the shortest tenure as he is currently serving as president.
Jimmy Carter has the highest average executive orders, while Barack Obama has the lowest. However, the number of executive orders does not determine the effectiveness of leadership as it can vary based on various factors and priorities.
Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and William J. Clinton have served two full terms and Richard Nixon one full term and one partial due to some issues.

**Conclusion:**
Every President brings a distinct set of qualities, experiences, and perspectives to their role, distinguishing each presidency. Even though obstacles can vary, it is essential to recognize that seemingly insurmountable tasks can be completed with sincere and dedicated effort. Each President can make a lasting impact by capitalizing on their individual strengths and embracing the possibility of positive change.
